Artifacts can include personal development plans, goal statements, reflection exercises, action items, progress tracking, and other coaching-related content.
Users maintain a single active artifact per coaching session, though they can revise and iterate on it throughout their journey.
The platform supports both text-based coaching content and structured planning documents.
